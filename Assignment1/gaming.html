      <h1> GAMING | An IASC Major Enjoys Games?! Crazy I know...  </h1>
    </div>

<p> As an IASC student, it may be a little obvious that I enjoy video games. Not mostly as a hobby but I enjoy video games as a competitive hobby or eSport as many would put it. Below I have added a few photos over the past few years from tournaments and other related things.

<p> The series of photos were all taken from tournaments I have attended within the past few years. As I am a heavy into the FPS genre, I compete in Call of Duty. But besides that I enjoy eSports and many other games as well. My all time favourite game is Final Fantasy 7 and all time favourite console would be the dreamcast or ps2 as those were my main consoles as a kid and while I was growing up. </p>
